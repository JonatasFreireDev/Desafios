# Challenge 06 - React Native

<p>this is my first application developed with React Native, there are many possibilities to do so many different things.</p>

<p>this app basically asks you to enter the name of a favorite person to see their stars and access their page on github</p>

<p>little by little I get better in Javascript :)</p>
