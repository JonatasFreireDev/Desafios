# My first app with ReactJS

<p>This is my first step with ReactJS and I love It.</p>
<p>Every time I'm discover a new something in this universe of Javascript, I think It's so nice and I get so excited to learn more and more about it.</p>

<h3>About this mini project</h3>

<p>This is a Rocketseat Bootcamp challenge, basically, Its just a static page and based on Facebook where there is posts and comentery</p>
<p>I learned the base of ReactJS and yours components, a little of props and how to pass It to other components, the base of Babel and WebPack and how configure the two of them</p>
<p>Although It's a simple project, Already It's a begining.</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>
